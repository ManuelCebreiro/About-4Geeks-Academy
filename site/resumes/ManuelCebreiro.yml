    summary: |
        I am someone who loves everything in the world of informatics and technology, specially in web developing.
        Not only am I flexible when it comes to learning new things, but I am also excited to do so. I like to learn
        things by myself or with a team, and I'm looking forward to learning the metholodologies of other people when
        it comes to problem solving and any area.
